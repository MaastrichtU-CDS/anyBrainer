such as training, validation, and testing steps. 

Includes:
- BaseModel: Base class for all models
- MAEModel: Model for masked autoencoder
- ContrastiveModel: Model for contrastive learning

The model is responsible for:
- Defining the model architecture
- Defining the loss function
- Defining the optimizer
- Defining the learning rate scheduler
- Defining the training, validation, and testing steps
